CUNQA by example
================

Here some examples will be displayed and explained in order to understand not only how CUNQA works, 
but also its purpose and goals. This section provides a complete overview of the CUNQA 
functionalities. Each subsection follows the structure outlined below:

1. Code examples that explore the underlying concepts and functionalities.
2. A working example that allows users to directly try the functionalities and validate the concepts.

In this way, users can understand the fundamental concepts presented in each subsection and observe
how they are applied in practice. The main topics covered in this section are the following:

- :doc:`cunqacircuit`: complete guide on how to use and take advantage of this custom circuit
  representation.
- :doc:`no_communications`: explanation of the limitations and considerations involved in the
  distribution of quantum tasks without communication between parties.
- :doc:`classical_communications`: description of scenarios in which classical communication is
  allowed, including its impact on coordination and task execution.
- :doc:`quantum_communications`: overview of quantum communication mechanisms and their role in
  enabling more advanced distributed quantum workflows.

Together, these topics provide a solid foundation for understanding the design principles and
capabilities of CUNQA in distributed quantum computing scenarios.
