Quantum-communications scheme
*****************************

The quantum-communications directives, together with simple examples, are explained in the :doc:`../cunqa_overview/quantum_comm` section. 
This section will present a couple of examples are presented to highlight the use of quantum communications.


In this first example we present an example of distributed QPE, so that the results obtained can be compared with the ones in :doc:`no_communications` and :doc:`classical_communications`.
