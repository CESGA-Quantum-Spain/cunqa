Further examples
==================

Here some examples will be displayed and explained in order to understand CUNQA 
functionalities and purposes. Each subsection follows the structure outlined below:

1. Code examples that explore the underlying concepts.
2. A functional example that can be executed by users to validate them.

As CUNQA supports the main three DQC schemes, this section will cover
all of them by the following:

- :doc:`basic_usage`: basic guide on how to use the CUNQA API.
- :doc:`no_communications`: distributing quantum tasks without inter-QPU communications.
- :doc:`classical_communications`: send and receive classical bits between vQPUs.
- :doc:`quantum_communications`: quantum communications through **teledata** and **telegate** protocols.

All together, these topics provide a solid foundation for understanding the design principles and
capabilities of CUNQA in distributed quantum computing scenarios.
